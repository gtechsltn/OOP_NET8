# OOPs in .NET 8.0

## OOPs Concepts:

+ Class
+ Objects
+ Data **Abstraction**
+ **Encapsulation**
+ **Inheritance**
+ **Polymorphism**
+ Dynamic Binding
+ Message Passing

## Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs is a programming style that is associated with concepts like:

+ **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a process where one class acquires the properties of another.
+ **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping up the data and code together as a single unit.
+ **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation details from the user and only providing the functionality to the users.
+ **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take multiple forms

### Why was OOP invented?

**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) was invented to address several limitations of procedural programming paradigms and to improve software development practices. Here are the key reasons for its invention:

+ **Modularity**: OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating data and behavior into objects. This makes it easier to manage and understand large codebases, as each object can be developed and tested independently.
+ **Reusability**: OOP allows for code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism. Developers can create new classes based on existing ones, reducing redundancy and speeding up development.
+ **Maintainability**: The encapsulation of data and methods within objects makes it easier to modify and maintain code. Changes to one part of the system can often be made with minimal impact on other parts.
+ **Abstraction**: OOP enables abstraction, allowing developers to focus on high-level functionalities rather than the low-level implementation details. This simplifies complex systems and makes them easier to understand.
+ **Real-world modeling**: OOP aligns more closely with how we perceive and interact with the real world. Objects can represent real-world entities, making it easier for developers to model complex systems.
+ **Improved collaboration**: OOP facilitates teamwork by allowing multiple developers to work on different objects or classes simultaneously, which can enhance productivity and reduce conflicts.

OOP became popular in the 1980s and 1990s with the rise of languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java, as it provided a more structured approach to programming that aligned well with the growing complexity of software applications.
